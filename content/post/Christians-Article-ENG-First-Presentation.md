My name is Christian, I was born in Cava dei Tirreni, a small town of about 80k inhabitants less than 10km from Salerno.

I spent all my childhood, adolescence and my student period in this territory, developing that sense of belonging that unites entire peoples and that is able to make you appreciate the wonders that you have under your eyes every day (and that maybe, for a long time go, with the strength of the habit, then you tend not to notice anymore, taking them for granted).
I graduated at the University of Salerno, already with the certainty to leave my home in order to find a stable job, because now they have become accustomed to thinking so. Who has never heard the famous phrase "if you want to work you have to get out of here" or even "if you want to make a career run away from Italy", even more drastic. Needless to deny, there is a fund of truth: the damage caused to our economic system (and not only), mainly in southern Italy, is considerable, but I wonder: who established it? Who determined that you have to go away to work? Who determined that whoever wants to stay in their own land should move? We have been raised with values, traditions, and the training system of down, it would be nice to be able to reciprocate in some way, don't you agree? Well, in 2020 technological progress (whose interest unites us) allows us to do extraordinary things: 20 years ago it was not believed that remote job positions could be created, expressly requested by contract. The figure of the remote worker or the digital nomad, allows us to be the beginning of a change ourselves: recovering with our software passion what made us believe we must necessarily leave with their hardware vision.

TechSalerno's idea is to create a community of computer science, programming languages, new technologies enthusiasts ... but in a synergistic way with the unconditional love for Salerno.

The idea was born (strange right?) from a Californian boy, who decided to move from what we see as "the promised land", right in Salerno. Of course, everyone is different, everyone has their own vision of life, but maybe (and I say maybe), this can help to reflect all the people (me too) that there is a pinch of hope, that Salerno can actually be compared to San Francisco, and that, with a handful of amazement (but also not), it can even win the match (for sure, with Dan, it once happened).

We have a wonderful territory, we can go rapidly from the sea to the mountains, the Amalfi and Cilento coasts act as our bodyguard, the best food: imagine programming on the seafront, organizing meetings on the beach, business calls with the background of the seagulls, brainstorming walking barefoot on the sand: you can do it!
Immediately after graduating, like many others, I worked in Milan for several companies, touring the area a lot and believe me if I say that what is in Salerno is not elsewhere.

We have the opportunity to change the course of the history of the classic graduate boy (and not only), to help each other, to bring various experiences in one place to be able to make the best choices and to appreciate the luck of being there: this is TechSalerno!
