What Salerno is to me

I was born in California, north of San Francisco in the Napa Valley, during the earlier years of the wine industry boom. My father was a viticulturist then, helping establish vineyards that would last decades. My mother, an artist and immigrant from Brazil, came to the USA to escape political persecution and seek better opportunities. I spent part of my life as a child in Washington state, as well as going back and forth to Brazil to visit family. 

I grew up seeing some extremes in the world, between the devastating poverty of Brazil and the affluence of wine country elites. I'm grateful for the perspective on privilege it gave me, and to this day I think it helps me understand what makes for an inclusive, supportive, healthy, and vibrant community. I've seen the vacant lots and vacant stares that come from disengagement, apathy, and greed. I saw the wounds of negligent commercialism and looked into the eyes of mothers and children it left behind. 

I knew I loved Salerno the first time I ever passed through it. On my way to Florence one summer, I took a Freccia Rossa from the train station, and I only saw a brief glimpse of it from the hired car transfer we took from our vacation stay in Amalfi. I knew this place was special after only a few hours. 

Since moving here in the early Spring of 2019, I've loved every minute of my time here. I've said this many times to all who would listen to me gush about my new home, but the analogy I've constructed is, in the Venn diagram of all of my needs and wants for a place to reside, Salerno sits squarely at the center of all overlapping circles of importance. Having lived in San Francisco and the greater Bay Area for a majority of my life, as well as different cities in Europe and the US, I can confidently say that for knowledge workers like those of the larger tech sector, Salerno offers so much, I'm almost afraid to give away what seems like a well-kept secret. Of course, tastes vary, and Salerno is not a grandiose metropolis or manicured boutique walled garden for the affluent. Those things are all within reach, however, due to how well connected the city is. 

Salerno sports a decently sized train station connected to the main high-speed rail lines, and can have you in Rome in under 2 hours in all the comfort and convenience that the Freccia lines provide. There's also a decently sized port and two different ferry terminals, for a weekend trip up the Amalfi coast or over to Capri. It is trivial--especially from a Bay Area denizen's perspective--to catch a train or bus up to Napoli for the trappings of big city living, a dose of frenetic energy that broadens the already diverse possibilities of this part of Campania.

Salerno is also one of the sunniest, most pleasantly-weathered cities I've ever experienced in all of Italy; the geography and latitude are such that storms are tempered and clouds parted and replaced by breezes and warm sunshine more often than surrounding areas. 

Having felt the hackle-raising suspense of navigating Sao Paulo and certain parts of the Bay Area, I can confidently say that Salerno is a safe, tranquil city, with charming residents radiating a softened vivacity that is the hallmark of Southern Italians. There is a comfort and ease to the social atmosphere that invites and piques and relaxes at the same time. Families with children bask in the welcoming vibe of the lungomare and along the ancient streets, old folks meander and anchor family activities, all alive with a real sense of community. Even as an outsider, I've felt the warmth and welcoming of the people here, and have already made some fast friends, and find more friendly faces here than elsewhere I've been in Italy. 

The idea for TechSalerno came to my mind because of that old familiar feeling: love at first brush. Truly I can no more claim any credit for TechSalerno than I can for how wonderful this part of the world is general; Salerno is the true creator of this project. It's obvious from speaking to those who have joined this cause from the beginning, that this city speaks for itself that way, and I'm only grateful to try and facilitate a voice for that. This region is special to me, and I know those who experience it like I have will feel the same, and so we endeavor to share that, to give this place what it deserves, and make us all better for it. 

And that's just part of why I <3 Salerno.
